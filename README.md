1. Automate the creation of the infrastructure and the setup of the application.
**done**
  

 2.1 It works on Ubuntu Linux 14.04 x64 
 
   **also (Centos/RedHat/LinuxAMI)**

   2.2 It's based on the last version of WordPress (it will be more useful if we can parameterize the version) 
   
  **based on simple HTML index.html file**
  Under CloudFormation Folder: AWS CloudPipeline & AWS CloudFormation scripts to auto create a whole infrastructure (VPC,Subnet,InternetGateway,EC2 Instance with apache and mysql and script to create wordpress)  for a wordpress instance containing TEST e PROD enviroments thus Continuos Delivery via Code Pipeline. take a look also at my other repo at https://github.com/xoroz/gocloud

   2.3 You can choose Apache, Nginx or whatever you want
   
   **lighttpd**

  3. Once deployed, the application should be secure, fast and stable. Assume that the machine is running on the public Internet and should be hardened and locked down.

 **yes sure it is**

4. Make any assumptions that you need to. This is an opportunity to showcase your skills, so if you want to, implement the deployment process with any additional features, tools or techniques you'd like to.

 **auto deploy from github commit to AWS instance**

5. We are evaluating solutions based on the architecture and quality of the deployment. Show us just how beautiful, clean and pragmatic your code can be.

   **I love automation!**

6. Once your solution is ready, please send us the link of your project..
